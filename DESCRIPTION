Description: Group sequential multivariate one-sample log-rank tests can be applied when several time-to-event endpoints
  in an experimental group shall be compared with a reference distribution. In this case, we assume that this reference 
  distribution is specified by a multi-state (Semi-)Markov model. This package provides functions to execute interim and
  final analyses, compute the power of such trials (via simulation) and compute conditional power to enable sample size
  recalculations.
