\arguments{
\item{msm_data}{Data frame containing information about any (possible) transition of patients in the study with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item id - ID of the patient to whom this entry belongs
\item Tstart - Start of the observation period for this transition
\item Tstop - Stop of the observation period for this transition
\item duration - Duration of the observation period for this transition
\item from - Current state of the patient
\item to - State to which a transition is possible
\item status - Transition could (1) or could not be (0) observed
\item trans - Number of this transition (according to \code{to.trans2(transition_matrix)})
\item recruitment_date - Calendar date of recruitment of this patient
}
Maximum number of sample sizes under consideration should be at most the number of subjects in this data set}

\item{analysis_dates}{Vector of calendar dates of analyses}

\item{accrual_duration}{Duration of accrual period}

\item{current_analysis}{Number of the current analysis}

\item{reference_model}{Specification of the reference model against which the new data is tested. Should be an object of class "reference_model"}

\item{events}{List of (composite) events that shall be investigated}

\item{sample_sizes}{Vector of sample sizes that shall be investigated}

\item{norm}{Use either \eqn{L^2}-norm (\code{norm = "l2"}, default value) or \eqn{L^\infty}-norm (\code{norm = "linf"}) of vector of test statistics to compute stagewise p-values}

\item{boundaries}{Use either O'Brien-Fleming'S (\code{boundaries = "obf"}, default value) or Pocock's (\code{boundaries = "pocock"}) sequential decision boundaries}

\item{alpha}{Choose type I error rate (default value = 0.05)}

\item{weights}{Choose weights for inverse normal combination of stagewise p-values. Sum of squared values needs to sum up to 1.}

\description{
For a given data set, this function can efficiently compute the results of the group-sequential multivariate one-sample
log-rank test for different choices of sample sizes. This function is needed to efficiently estimate the power of such
trials for different sample sizes via simulation.
